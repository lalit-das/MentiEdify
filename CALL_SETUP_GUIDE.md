## üöÄ How to Start a Video Call

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### 1. **Create Users and Booking**
   - Register two users: one as **mentee**, one as **mentor**
   - Mentee books a session from the "Explore Mentors" page
   - Mentor accepts the booking from their dashboard

#### 2. **Starting the Call**

**Option A: Mentee Initiates**
   - Mentee goes to their dashboard
   - Clicks "Join Call" button on their upcoming session
   - System creates a `call_session` record with:
     - `caller_id`: Mentee's user ID
     - `callee_id`: Mentor's user ID
     - `status`: 'initiated'
   - Mentee is redirected to `/call/{sessionId}`
   - Mentor receives an **incoming call notification**

**Option B: Mentor Initiates**
   - Mentor goes to their dashboard
   - Clicks "Join Call" button on their upcoming session
   - System creates a `call_session` record with:
     - `caller_id`: Mentor's user ID
     - `callee_id`: Mentee's user ID
     - `status`: 'initiated'
   - Mentor is redirected to `/call/{sessionId}`
   - Mentee receives an **incoming call notification**

#### 3. **Answering the Call**
   - The **receiver** sees a full-screen incoming call notification
   - They can either:
     - Click "Answer" (green button) ‚Üí Joins the call
     - Click "Decline" (red button) ‚Üí Rejects the call
   - If not answered within 60 seconds ‚Üí Auto-rejected as "Missed Call"

#### 4. **In the Call Page**
   - Both users see their local video (bottom-left)
   - Remote video appears in the main area when connected
   - **Waiting Room**: If the other person hasn't joined, you see:
     - Their name and avatar
     - "Waiting for [name] to join" message
   - **Connection Status Badges**:
     - Timer showing call duration
     - Participant status (Waiting / Both Joined / Connected)
     - Connection quality (Good / Connecting / Poor)

#### 5. **During the Call**
   - Use control buttons to:
     - Toggle microphone (Mic / MicOff)
     - Toggle video (Video / VideoOff)
     - Open chat panel (MessageSquare)
     - Access settings (Settings)
   - **Connection Monitoring**:
     - Green WiFi icon = Good connection
     - Yellow Signal icon = Connecting
     - Red WiFi Off icon = Poor connection
   - If connection drops ‚Üí Automatic reconnection (up to 3 attempts)

#### 6. **Ending the Call**
   - Click "End Call" button (red, top-right)
   - System updates `call_session` with:
     - `status`: 'ended'
     - `ended_at`: Current timestamp
     - `duration_seconds`: Total call time
   - Both users are redirected to their dashboards
   - Booking status is marked as 'completed'

---

## üîß Technical Flow

### Database Schema (`call_sessions` table)
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- booking_id: UUID (references bookings)
- caller_id: UUID (user who initiated)
- callee_id: UUID (user who receives)
- call_type: 'audio' | 'video'
- status: 'initiated' | 'ringing' | 'connected' | 'ended' | 'failed'
- started_at: Timestamp when call connected
- ended_at: Timestamp when call ended
- duration_seconds: Total call duration
```

### WebRTC Connection Flow

1. **Initiator (Caller)**:
   - Gets local media stream (camera/microphone)
   - Creates RTCPeerConnection
   - Generates SDP offer
   - Sends offer via Supabase Realtime
   - Waits for answer

2. **Receiver (Callee)**:
   - Gets local media stream
   - Creates RTCPeerConnection
   - Receives offer via Supabase Realtime
   - Generates SDP answer
   - Sends answer back

3. **ICE Candidate Exchange**:
   - Both peers exchange ICE candidates
   - WebRTC establishes peer-to-peer connection
   - Video/audio streams start flowing

4. **Connection Monitoring**:
   - Connection state tracked: 'new' ‚Üí 'connecting' ‚Üí 'connected'
   - If 'failed' ‚Üí Automatic retry (max 3 attempts)
   - If 'disconnected' ‚Üí Shows reconnecting overlay

### Presence System

- Uses Supabase Realtime Presence
- Channel name: `presence-{sessionId}`
- Tracks when participants join/leave
- Updates UI to show "Waiting" vs "Both Joined" status

## üéØ Testing Your Call System

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Call Flow
1. Open two browser windows (or use incognito for second user)
2. Login as Mentee in Window 1
3. Login as Mentor in Window 2
4. Create and confirm a booking
5. Mentee clicks "Join Call"
6. Mentor should see incoming call notification
7. Mentor clicks "Answer"
8. Both should see each other's video

### Test Scenario 2: Call Rejection
1. Follow steps 1-6 above
2. Mentor clicks "Decline" instead
3. Call should end immediately
4. Mentee should see error/rejection message

### Test Scenario 3: Call Timeout
1. Follow steps 1-6 above
2. Don't click anything for 60 seconds
3. Call should auto-reject
4. Mentor should see "Missed Call" notification

### Test Scenario 4: Connection Recovery
1. Establish a call between two users
2. Temporarily disable network on one side
3. Should see "Reconnecting..." overlay
4. Re-enable network
5. Connection should restore automatically

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera/Microphone Not Working
- **Issue**: Browser blocks camera/microphone access
- **Solution**:
  - Check browser permissions (usually in address bar)
  - Allow camera and microphone for your site
  - If on localhost, use `https://` or `http://localhost`

### No Incoming Call Notification
- **Issue**: Callee doesn't see call notification
- **Check**:
  - Is the callee logged in?
  - Check browser console for "Call notification listener initialized"
  - Verify `call_sessions` record was created in database

### Video Freezes or Lags
- **Issue**: Poor connection quality
- **Solution**:
  - Check WiFi/network connection
  - System will show "Poor" connection badge
  - Automatic retry will attempt to reconnect

### "Waiting for participant" Forever
- **Issue**: Other user hasn't joined the call page
- **Solution**:
  - Verify both users clicked "Join Call"
  - Check that they're on the same `sessionId`
  - Look for presence channel subscription in console

### WebRTC Offer/Answer Failed
- **Issue**: Signaling messages not exchanged
- **Check**:
  - Browser console for WebRTC logs (prefixed with üöÄ, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)
  - Supabase Realtime channel is connected
  - Both users have different roles (one initiator, one receiver)

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Works best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest versions)
   - Requires HTTPS in production (HTTP only works on localhost)

2. **STUN/TURN Servers**:
   - Currently using Google's free STUN servers
   - For production, consider adding TURN servers for better NAT traversal

3. **Permissions**:
   - Users MUST grant camera/microphone permissions
   - System will show mock video stream if camera denied (for testing)

4. **Database RLS**:
   - Call sessions are protected by Row Level Security
   - Users can only access calls where they're caller or callee

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Always click "End Call" properly to clean up resources
   - Browser close/refresh will stop streams but may not update DB
